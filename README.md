# AWS User Consent Tab Close

When using the AWS apps user-consent mechanism, you are redirected to
a page telling you successfully gave consent.

This addon closes those tabs automatically as soon as they are loaded.

This is based on [Zoom Tab
Close](https://github.com/cshields/zoom-tab-close) which does the same
for tabs left behind by Zoom.

v1.0 - initial release
